A minimalistic programming language I made in my spare time

## Introduction

velo is designed to be a simple and easily maintainable general purpose programming language similar to those of `javascript` and `python`

> But why?
> I created velo to teach myself how to write an interpreter
> But still, why?
> I guess I got bored
